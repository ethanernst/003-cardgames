**Week 4+5: 10/15 - 10/28**

Tabletop cardgame engine

Project pre-extended to 2 weeks due to travel plans.

**Goals:** Test out class based components and class inheritance, and create a cardgame engine / editor that can be used to create custom cardgames.

**10/28:** Base components for the cardgame engine are complete, cards and gameplay pieces are draggable and card decks can be locked in place and draw/instantiate cards in predefined order. Most game image assets are prepared, but needs some state and UI work for building games.

**Reflections/Improvements for future:** Need to figure out a method of handling global state and add UI for building/saving/loading games, as well as setting up predefined games. Class components did not cooperate with how I have styled-components set up, but I would like to explore options for inheritance at some point.
